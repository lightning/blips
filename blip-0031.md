## Abstract

This bLIP defines a simple protocol by which a paying party can include an encrypted message for a
payment recipient iff both parties have indicated they wish to communicate with each other.

## Specification

This protocol is defined in terms of two parties: (a) the initiator, and (b) the message-sender. In
the lightning context, the message-sender is the payment sender, and the initiator is the payment
recipient.

Each party is configured with a private key (`k`) and a list of acceptable public keys they wish to
exchange messages with (`P`).

Each party stores the set `s` of the result of `H(ECDH_SALT || H(ECDH(k, P_i)))` for each `P_i` in `P`.

The initiator picks a random 32-byte nonce `initiator_n`. It then generates the init bytes, which are:
 * [`u16`:`handshake_count`]
 * [`48*handshake_count*byte`:`per_peer_handshake`]
 * [`u16`:`repeated_data_len`]
 * [`repeated_data_len*byte`:`repeated_data`]

The initiator:
 * MUST set `handshake_count` to a number greater than its trusted peer set count, using round
   values to avoid revealing how many trusted peers it has configured.
 * MUST fill in each `per_peer_handshake` with either:
   * pseudorandom data for any excess unused trusted peer entries,
   * `AEAD(initiator_n, s_i, PROTO_SALT, PROTO_AAD)` for each `s_i` in the initiator's `s` set.
 * MAY include `repeated_data` which will be received with the message to avoid storing state.
 * MUST set `repeated_data_len` to the length of `repeated_data`, if any.

The message-sender:
 * MUST ignore any bytes which are included after the end of `repeated_data`.
 * SHOULD walk each `per_peer_handshake` and check whether it is decryptable using each `s_i` it
   has stored.
 * If a `per_peer_handshake` is decryptable, should send a response including the message.

The message sender similarly picks a random 32-byte nonce `messenger_n` and responds with:
 * [`u16`:`handshake_index`]
 * [`48*byte`:`encrypted_nonce`]
 * [`u16`:`repeated_data_len`]
 * [`repeated_data_len*byte`:`repeated_data`]
 * [`u16`:`message_length`]
 * [`message_length*byte`:`encrypted_message`]

The message-sender:
 * MUST set `handshake_index` to the index of the `per_peer_handshake` they were able to decrypt
   within the init bytes.
 * MUST set `encrypted_nonce` to
   `AEAD(messenger_n, H(s_i || initiator_n), PROTO_SALT ^ MASK_A, PROTO_AAD)`
 * MUST include the same `repeated_data_len` and `repeated_data` as was sent by the initiator.
 * MUST set `message_length` to the length of the message they wish to send, *including* the
   16-byte MAC tag. If they only wish to communicate a message separately, `message_length` MUST be
   set to 0.
 * MAY calculate two message encryption keys by reading 64 bytes from
   `ChaCha20(initiator_n ^ messenger^n, KEY_STRETCH_SALT)`. The first 32 bytes are `inline_msg_key`,
   the next 32 bytes are `oob_msg_key`.
 * If `message_length` is not zero, MUST set `encrypted_message` to
   `AEAD(message, inline_msg_key, PROTO_SALT ^ MASK_B, PROTO_AAD)`
 * MAY exchange further messages with the initiator, using the `oob_msg_key` to encrypt and
   authenticate such messages.

The initiator (message recipient):
 * If `message_length` is between 1 and 15 (inclusive), the handshake should be treated as having
   failed.
 * MUST ignore any bytes which are included after the end of `encrypted_message`.
 * SHOULD decrypt the `encrypted_nonce` and use the contained `messenger_n` to decrypt the
   `message`.
 * MAY exchange further messages with the message-sender, using the `oob_msg_key` to encrypt and
   authenticate such messages.

### Constants
 * `H()` is SHA-256
 * `ECDH()` is ECDH using secp256k1 public/secret keys.
 * `AEAD(data, key, salt, aad)` is the ChaCha20Poly1305 RFC variant authenticated encryption
 * `ECDH_SALT` is "Mutual Message Exchange ECDH Result"
 * `KEY_STRETCH_SALT` is "INLINE KEY STRCH"
 * `MASK_A` is all 0xff bytes
 * `MASK_B` is all 0xf0 bytes
 * `PROTO_SALT` is a salt picked to describe a specific protocol using this message exchange
 * `PROTO_AAD` is excess data used to describe a specific instantiation of this protocol, for
   example the specific TLV which is being used to communicate a particular type of message.

## Discussion

There are various times during which lightning senders may wish to include a message for the
recipient. In many cases, the sender wishes to include such a message no matter the recipient,
often accomplished by simply including that message as an additional TLV entry in the recipient's
onion. However, in some cases the sender wishes to only include their message if there is mutual
trust between the sender and the recipient.

Prior to BOLT12, this was still a rather simple problem - senders could validate the recipient
node_id against a list of parties they wished to message and then include their message in the
onion as they otherwise would. However, with BOLT12 node_ids are no longer immediately visible.
Worse, as the number of payment protocols continues to proliferate, senders need to have a list
of acceptable messaging peers in multiple formats, maintained separately.

This bLIP defines a simple protocol by which a paying party can include an encrypted message for a
payment recipient iff both parties have indicated they wish to communicate with each other. It only
requires the ability for the payment recipient to include additional bytes (~48 bytes per peer they
are willing to exchange messages with). From there, the sender only has to include an extra 100-200
bytes in addition to the message itself in the onion they ultimately use to send the payment.

If the sender is not in the recipient's trusted peers list, they will not learn anything about who
the recipient is. However if the recipient does trust the sender, the sender may be able to learn
who the recipient is even if the sender does not trust the recipient (and thus no message will be
exchanged).

This protocol is envisioned for use in BOLT12 payment exchanges, however it can be used in any
payment negotiation protocol, or even in non-payment contexts.

## Rationale

There are several alternative protocols which could be considered.

First, the protocol could be split into one additional message - instead of the initiator being the
payment recipient, the payment sender could initiate. This would result in less data being included
in the final HTLC, however it would result in most of the CPU cost being borne by the (potential)
payment recipient, rather than the payment sender. This could allow for nodes to initiate the
protocol repeatedly with a victim, DoSing them without ever sending a payment.

Second, the protocol could be made further private by excluding the MACs in the initiator's bytes.
This would result in the responder being forced to include `N*M` `encrypted_nonce`s in their
response (implying the first change above as it would now be too large to include in an onion). This
would result in the responder not learning whether they were in the initiator's trusted set unless
they also trusted the initiator, however at the cost of substantial overhead. Because the
anticipated use cases of this protocol imply mutual trust, this is not considered worth the
trade-off. Further, this would also present challenges in situations where we only have a full RTT
available, namely in the BOLT12 `refund` case.
