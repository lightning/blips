## Abstract

LNURL-withdraw is a bech32-encoded HTTPS query string or sub-protocol of LNURL 
which gives the users the ability to receive funds via Lightning Network without the need of manually create an invoice.
Users scan a QRcode or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet, 
this queries a server and gets a JSON with some info, 
such as the max amount the user can receive, the min amount the user can request, etc. 
Then the wallet typically asks the user to enter an amount and under the hood it creates a Lightning invoice and sends it to the service provider, 
which eventually pays that.
From a high level the user-visible flow consists of:

1. Scan the QR code / paste the LNURL-withdraw link into the wallet
2. Enter the amount to receive
3. Confirm

In this repo I schematize a LNURL-withdraw flow for POS, 
which sees the interaction between the user and a POS equipped with a NFC sensor.

This bLIP serves to document a reference flow for open source implementations of POS devices able to read LNURL-withdraw links via NFC,
for a better UX in Lightning payments powered by LNURL protocol.

## Specification

This flowchart shows the entire flow which combines the already well-known LNURL-withdraw sub-protocol with NFC-enabled POS.

The main actor of the flow here is the merchant/payee, not the payer: 
the merchant/payee has to simply enter an amount on the POS and this will active the NFC sensor, 
waiting to receive the LNURL-withdraw link. The payer has to transmit the LNURL-withdrawPOS link via NFC
and doesn't need to confirm the payment on the wallet.

## Motivation

Payees that support this open flow help improving the UX of Lightning payments:
a user can just pay with a NFC tag in which a LNURL-withdraw link has been stored, instead of asking the payee to create an Invoice and scanning the QRcode.

With this flow the users can also make "offline" payments and this completely change the UX of a Lightning payment: 
they could reserve a part of their funds on a LN wallet for "offline" payments in a LNURL-withdraw string, 
so they can use it offline, for example when they are abroad and don't have a stable connection or have roaming issues. 
They could also define sub-balances in their wallet, so once the reserved funds are ended, no other funds in their wallet is touched.

## Rationale

There are security concerns in regards to LNURL-withdraw links used as prepaid Lightning cards, which are expressed [here](https://github.com/theDavidCoen/LNURL-withdrawPOS#security-concerns-in-regards-to-lnurl-withdraw-links), but this bLIP aims just to clarify how the receiving part of the flow works and to represent a guide for an open standard, so it's not its goal to highlight them.
<br>With an open standard we can have interoperability between many different apps and services that use LNURL protocol and the client-server interaction, in a custodial or completely non-custodial way.
<br>This way we can share a common UX, very similar to what we have with fiat prepaid/debit/credit cards.

## Differencies between BOLT11 invoice, LNURL-withdraw, LNURL-pay and LNURL-withdrawPOS flows

**Normal BOLT11 invoice:**
- Payer must be online to pay
- Payee/Merchant must be online to receive
- Payee/Merchant doesn't need (but can) to specify an amount to receive. 
- Payee/Merchant tipically shows a QR code or sends a textual Lightning invoice.

**LNURL-pay:**
- Payer must be online to decode the LNURL-pay link and pay
- Payee/Merchant must be online to ask the server to create the LNURL-pay link and receive
- Payee/Merchant doesn't need (but can) to specify an amount to receive. 
- Payee/Merchant tipically shows a QR code or sends a textual LNURL.

**LNURL-withdraw:**
- Payer must be online to ask the server to create the LNURL link
- Payee/Merchant must be online to decode the LNURL-withdraw link and receive
- Payee/Merchant must specify the amount to receive (withdraw) **in the aftermath**, selecting from a range (minWithdrawable/maxWithdrawable)
- Payee/Merchant tipically scans a QR code or requests a textual LNURL.

**LNURL-withdrawPOS:**
- Payer can be offline, its server is always online
- Payee/Merchant must be online to decode the LNURL-withdraw link and receive
- Payee/Merchant must specify the amount to receive (withdraw) **in advance** 
- Payer/Merchant doesn't need to scan the QR code or request a textual LNURL, but just waits for the payer to send the LNURL-withdraw link via NFC
