## Abstract

LNURL-withdraw is a bech32-encoded HTTPS query string or sub-protocol of LNURL 
which gives the users the ability to receive funds via Lightning Network without the need of manually create an invoice.
Users scan a QRcode or paste the LNURL-withdraw link into their wallet, 
this queries a server and gets a JSON with some info, 
such as the max amount the user can receive, the min amount the user can request, etc. 
Then the wallet tipically asks the user to enter an amount and under the hood it creates a Lightning invoice and sends it to the service provider, 
which eventually pays that.
So the only things the users have to do are:

1. Scan the QR code / paste the LNURL-withdraw link into the wallet
2. Enter the amount to receive
3. Confirm

In this repo I schematize a LNURL-withdraw flow for POS, 
which sees the interaction between the user and a POS equipped with a NFC sensor.

This bLIP serves to document what could be a reference flow for open source implementations of POS devices able to read LNURL-withdraw links via NFC,
for a better UX in Lightning payments powered by LNURL protocol.

## Specification

Sender:

* MUST include a TLV record keyed by type `5482373484` with a TLV value of a
  randomly generated and cryptographically-secure 32-byte value that serves as
  the HTLC payment preimage
* MUST NOT reuse a previously used preimage
* MUST NOT reuse a preimage from a previously paid invoice
* MUST set the `payment_hash` field in the `update_add_htlc` message to match
  the SHA256 hash of the payment preimage
* SHOULD only send payments to nodes advertising the `keysend` feature bit

Receiver:

* if failing the payment due to not wanting to accept keysend payments or if
  the preimage does not match the payment hash, SHOULD error with
  `PERM|15 incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details`.

## Motivation

A convenience of layer 1 bitcoin is being able to spontaneously send to a
bitcoin address with no advance work required on the part of the payee. Keysend
brings the convenience of sponaneous payments to layer 2 (with a few caveats,
see the [Drawbacks](#keysend-drawbacks) section).

As previously mentioned, keysend also has the advantage of already being
supported by major implementations. So regardless of whether it is the best
solution to spontaneous payments, it's a good idea to have some form of
official documentation for it.

## Rationale

Design decisions for keysend were largely made by the original lnd keysend
implementation (e.g. the choice of `5482373484` for the TLV type).

* The TLV type `5482373484` was chosen at random
* The rationale behind having a feature bit is that it's nicer to opt-in to
  receiving keysend payments: without a feature bit, the only way for senders to
  explicitly know that receivers support keysend is by attempting a keysend
  payment and seeing whether or not it fails.

## Keysend Drawbacks

* Inability for the payee to specify their preferred `min_final_cltv_expiry`.
  This is an issue because payer and payee may have differing security
  requirements, which could lead to payment failures if the payee considers the
  payer's choice of `min_final_cltv_expiry` too high or too low.
* Loss of being able to use the preimage and invoice signature as
  proof-of-payment. With regular lightning payments, payers are able to use (1)
  the payment preimage and (2) the invoice signature in a situation where they
  need to prove that they made a payment (the invoice signature is necessary to
  prove that the payer was not an intermediary hop). This proof cannot be
  provided for keysend payments because the preimage is provided by the payer to
  begin with and no invoice is being paid.
* Keysend is expected to be deprecated in favor of a more well-developed
  spontaneous payment solution like
  [Offers](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/798) or
  [AMP](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/pull/658)
