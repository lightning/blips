## Abstract

This bLIP defines a new [tagged field][tagged-fields] for the payment invoice
encoding described by [BOLT 11][bolt11] which can be used to communicate 
encoded blinded path information to the payer of the invoice.

## Rational

Blinded paths have been included in the [BOLT 4 specification][blinded-paths] 
and using them in the context of receiving payments is natively supported in 
the [BOLT 12 Offers proposal][offers]. However, the Offers proposal also 
includes various other dependencies such as onion messaging and various new 
protocol message all of which will require a network wide upgrade before full 
advantage can be taken of the new protocol. Blinded paths themselves are a 
useful tool for privacy and potentially more reliable payment delivery due to 
receiver being able to select paths it knows to be more reliable. This document 
proposes a carve-out to the existing [BOLT 11][bolt11] invoice format so that 
testing of blinded paths can be done in implementations that have not yet 
implemented the full Offers specification. This will be done by adding a new 
tagged-field type to the BOLT 11 invoice specification that will encode a 
blinded payment path. With this bLIP, the sender and the receiver of a payment 
will need to be aware of the new tagged-field and the receiver will need to 
support route blinding and ideally have direct channel peers who also support 
route blinding in order to start widening their anonymity set.

## Specification

### Feature Bit

A new feature bit, `bolt11_blinded_path`, for the `I` context will be added 
using bits from the experimental range. This is required because the BOLT 11 
tagged-fields pre-date the TLV format and so nodes parsing the invoice will just
skip fields they don't know as there is no concept of "It's OK to be odd". This
feature bit thus allows nodes to fail fast if they do not yet understand the new
tagged field.

### Tagged Field

The proposal is to add the following new [tagged field][tagged-fields] to the 
set defined in [BOLT 11][bolt11]:

- `b` (20): `data_length` variable. One or more entries each containing a 
   blinded payment path for a private route; there may be more than one `b` 
   field. The field uses the `blinded_payinfo` type described below which draws 
   heavily on the proposed encoding of the `blinded_payinfo` subtype defined in 
   the [Offers proposal][offers].

1. subtype: `blinded_payinfo`
2. data:
  * [`u32`:`fee_base_msat`]
  * [`u32`:`fee_proportional_millionths`]
  * [`u16`:`cltv_expiry_delta`]
  * [`u64`:`htlc_minimum_msat`]
  * [`u64`:`htlc_maximum_msat`]
  * [`u16`:`flen`]
  * [`flen*byte`:`features`]
  * [`33*byte`:`first_ephemeral_blinding_point`]
  * [`byte`:`num_hops`]
  * [`num_hops*blinded_hop`:`blinded_hops`]

1. subtype: `blinded_hop`
2. data:
   * [`33*byte`:`blinded_node_pubkey`]
   * [`bigsize`: `cipher_text_length`]
   * [`cipher_text_length*byte`:`cipher_text`]

The `blinded_node_pubkey` of the first `blinded_hop` in a `blinded_payinfo` is
the real public key of the blinded path's introduction node. This encoding was 
chosen so that `num_hops` accurately reflects the true number of hops including 
the introduction node while keeping the number of bytes required for the 
encoding to a minimum. The `cipher_text` is the `encrypted_recipient_data` as 
defined in [BOLT 4 TLV payload][bolt4-payload].

The `fee_base_msat`, `fee_proportional_millionths` and `cltv_expiry_delta` are 
the accumulated blinded route policy values as defined in [BOLT 4][bolt4-relay].
`features` is the set of features for the path, `first_ephemeral_blinding_point`
is the blinding point that must be communicated to the introduction node via the
`blinding` field of the [`payload`][bolt4-payload] type.

** Note: see discussion section for question around communicating 
`max_cltv_expiry` **

### Requirements

An invoice containing the `b` field type:
- MUST not contain the `r` field type.
- MUST not contain the `s` field type since a payment address in the context of
  blinded payments does not make sense since the recipient is able to use the
  `path_id` in the `encrypted_recipient_data` for the same purpose.
- SHOULD sign the invoice with a private key that is not the same as their 
  public node ID and should not set the destination node (`n` field).
- Each `blinded_path` must fit within the `data_length` size limit. This places
  an upper limit of approximately 7 `blinded_hops` on each path. See the 
  appendix for the estimation calculation.
- If the invoice will be displayed in QR form, then this also places an upper
  limit on the number of `blinded_path` fields that can be added to the 
  invoice.
- The existing `c` field (`min_final_cltv_expiry_delta`) is meaningless for an
  invoice containing the `b` field since this value is expected to be accounted 
  for in each path's accumulated `cltv_expiry_delta`.
- The existing invoice `expiry` field along with the `timestamp` field  
  should be used to communicate the `max_cltv_expiry` of the blinded paths in 
  the invoice. The reader should use the 10-minutes-per-block assumption to 
  calculate an estimation of the `max_cltv_exipiry` value.

## Universality

This proposal is a temporary measure that will allow users to start making use
of blinded paths in the context of payments and thereby take advantage of the 
potential privacy and payment success rate benefits that they will in theory 
provide. Once the Offers protocol along with its new invoice format has been 
widely deployed, then there will be no use for this BOLT 11 carve-out. Due to 
the forcasted temporary use of the new field, it makes sense to be in bLIP form
rather than adding this in a more temporary way to the spec via a BOLT update 
proposal. The intent is that this will be used mostly for testing of blinded
paths in implementations that have not yet implemented the full Offers spec.

## Backwards Compatibility

BOLT 11 states that the reader of an invoice "MUST skip over unknown fields". 
This means that an un-updated reader of an invoice that includes the new tagged 
field would skip it when parsing the invoice. The proposal also adds a new 
feature bit to the invoice feature bit vector and so this gives nodes an 
indication that the invoice includes something they do not yet understand. 
Even if un-upgraded senders did not check the feature bit vector, they would not
be able to use the invoice as, without knowledge of the blinded path field, it
does not contain enough information to attempt a payment since no routing hints
will be included and the invoice will be signed with a random ephemeral key 
meaning that the derived destination node would not correspond to a real node 
in the graph.

## Reference Implementations

The proposed encoding of the new BOLT 11 tagged-field is added to the LND 
implementation in [this PR][impl].

### Size Restrictions

#### `data_length` Limit

In order to conform to any existing BOLT 11 invoice parser, each new tagged
field must use the `data_length` encoding defined there. This means that the
maximum size of any _single_ encoded blinded path is 639 bytes.

What follows is a rough estimation of the maximum number of hops we can include
in a single blinded path. It assumes that each hop's cipher text is the same
length.

##### Cipher Text Size Estimation

First, a rough estimation of the average cipher text length is required. A
forwarding node in a blinded path will receive a cipher text payload containing
the following data:

- `padding`: optional
- `short_channel_id` of 8 bytes
- `payment_relay`:
    * 2 byte `cltv_expiry_delta`
    * 4 byte `fee_proportional_millionths`
    * 4 byte `fee_base_msat`
- `payment_constraints`:
    * 4 byte `max_cltv_expiry`
    * 8 byte `htlc_minimum_msat`
- `allowed_features`: optional

If we [assume that the `allowed_features` vector is not
set][empty-allowed-features], then this comes to a total of 30 mandatory bytes.

For the recipient node, it will receive a cipher text payload containing:

- `padding`: optional
- `path_id`: let's assume that this is 32 bytes like the existing payment
  address.
- `payment_constraints`:
    * 4 byte `max_cltv_expiry`
    * 8 byte `htlc_minimum_msat`

This comes to a total of 44 bytes for the recipient's cipher text.

The padding field should be used by recipients to pad cipher text blobs so that
all are the same size. Since the calculated recipient cipher text blob size (44)
is larger than that of the forwarding nodes (30), we can assume that all the
cipher text blobs will have a size of around 44 bytes.

##### `blinded_hop` Size Estimation

The total number of bytes required for a single `blinded_hop` is:

    = 33+bigsize_len(cipher_text)+len(cipher_text)

If we use the estimated `cipher_text` size of 44 bytes, then 
`bigsize_len(cipher_text)` is 1 and so this comes to 78 bytes for a single 
`blinded_hop`.

##### `blinded_payinfo` Size Estimation

The total number of bytes required for the encoding of a single
`blinded_payinfo` entry is:

    = 4+4+2+8+8+2+len(features)+33+1+(num_hops*len(blinded_hop))
    = 68+len(features)+(num_hops*len(blinded_hop))

If we take the estimate of 78 bytes per `blinded_hop` and if we assume an empty
feature vector then this comes to:

    = 68+(num_hops*78)

The maximum number of hops in a single blinded path can then be calculated to
be:

    639 = 68+(num_hops*78)
    num_hops = 7

#### QR code limit

Another soft maximum value to keep in mind is the maximum number of bytes that
can fit into a [QR code][qr] which is 2,953 bytes. This is a soft maximum
because this only applies if the invoice is in fact being transmitted via QR
code. This limit does not apply if the invoice is being transmitted via other
protocols such as LNURL. In the cases where the limit does apply, then two
variables will be at play:

- The number of blinded paths
- The number of blinded hops within each path (which will always also be
  restricted by the `data_length` maximum).

The exact limit on the number of blinded paths that can be included depends on
the size of other fields in the invoice. It is worth noting that an invoice with
a blinded path should not contain any `r` (route hint) fields.
