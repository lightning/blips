## Abstract

Bolt 12 introduces offers, which are static lightning "addresses". An offer can
be stored and reused to pay the same node many times. It then becomes natural to
associate Bolt 12 offers to your friends and contacts.

When sending payments to contacts, you may want them to know that the payment
came from you. We propose a scheme to deterministically derive the `payer_key`
used in the `invoice_request` based on the payer and payee's offers. Nodes
receiving payments can match the `payer_id` with their contact list to see if
the payment came from one of their contacts.

## Motivation

This feature provides a better UX for lightning wallets, by making payments
between trusted contacts look very similar to fiat payment applications.

## Specification

Payers derive a deterministic `payer_key` based on one of their offers, that
they expect the recipient to have in their contacts list, and the offer that
they are paying.

### Requirements

A node sending `invoice_request` for a given `offer`:

- If it wants to use a deterministic `payer_key`:
  - MUST compute the following tweak:
    - `tweak = SHA256("blip42_bolt12_contacts" || offer.offer_id)`.
  - MUST choose one of its own offers that the recipient may know:
    - MUST multiply the private key used to sign invoices for this offer with `tweak`.
    - MUST use the resulting private key as `payer_key` to sign the `invoice_request`.
- Otherwise:
  - SHOULD use a random `payer_key`.

A node receiving `invoice_request`:

- For each `offer` from its trusted contacts:
  - SHOULD compute the deterministic `payer_id` associated with that `offer`:
    - `tweak = SHA256("blip42_bolt12_contacts" || invoice_request.offer)`.
    - `payer_id = tweak * offer.node_id`.
  - SHOULD compare that `payer_id` with the `invoice_request`'s `payer_id`.
  - If they match:
    - SHOULD mark the payment as coming from this contact.
    - SHOULD display the `payer_note` contained in the `invoice_request`.

### Rationale

Nodes may compute their contacts' `payer_id`s once and store it along with that
contact instead of recomputing them on-the-fly whenever a payment is received.

When a payment comes from a trust contact, it is safe to display the payment's
`payer_note`: otherwise it may contain spam or phishing.
