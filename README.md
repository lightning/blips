# Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal

bLIP stands for Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposal. A bLIP is a design document
providing information to the Lightning community, or describing a new feature for
the Lightning Network. The bLIP should provide a concise technical specification of
the feature and a rationale for the feature. The bLIP author is responsible for
building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
Importantly, if a feature is intended to become universal or near universal, it must
be a [BOLT](https://github.com/lightning/bolts).

People wishing to submit bLIPs (Bitcoin Lightning Improvement Proposals) should
first propose their idea to the [Lightning development mailing
list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev). After
discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be
published here.

For more detail on the process, please read [bLIP-0001](./blip-0001.md) and
[bLIP-0002](./blip-0002.md).
