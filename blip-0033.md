## Abstract

Standard lightning channels require the channel opener to pay the mining fees
for the commitment transaction and mutual close transaction. This requirement
forces the channel opener to contribute to the funding transaction and makes
it impossible to open channels by only purchasing inbound liquidity from a
remote node.

We want to allow nodes to opt into paying the commitment transaction fees even
though they're not the channel opener.

## Specification

### `channel_flags` extension

We extend the `channel_flags` field from `open_channel2`. The BOLTs only use
the least-significant bit of that field, and require readers to ignore the
remaining bits. We define the next bit to `non_initiator_pays_commit_fees`: if
set, the acceptor will pay the mining fees of the commitment transaction, for
the lifetime of the channel.

### Requirements

The channel opener:

* MAY set `non_initiator_pays_commit_fees` when sending `open_channel2`.
* If the receiver sends `accept_channel2`:
  * MUST deduce the commitment fees from the remote node's channel balance.
  * MUST NOT send `update_fee` for the lifetime of the channel.

The channel acceptor:

* If `non_initiator_pays_commit_fees` is set in `open_channel2`:
  * MUST fail the channel if it doesn't want to pay the commitment fees.
  * Otherwise:
    * MUST respond with `accept_channel2`.
    * MUST contribute to the funding transaction.
    * MUST deduce the commitment fees from its channel balance.
    * SHOULD send `update_fee` when it wants to update the feerate of the
      commitment transaction.

When exchanging `shutdown` without `option_simple_close`:

* If `non_initiator_pays_commit_fees` is set:
  * The node responsible for paying the commitment fees is also responsible
    for paying the mutual close fees.
  * The node responsible for paying the commitment fees sends `closing_signed`
    first.

### Rationale

We don't define a feature bit to signal support for receiving this new channel
flag, because this feature doesn't make sense alone: protocols that need this
channel flag must explicitly mention that they include support for receiving
this flag.

Some messages that should be sent first by the channel opener are instead sent
first by the node paying the commitment fees wherever it makes sense. This is
the case for `update_fee` (since the node paying that fee should decide on the
feerate) and `closing_signed`.

### Test vectors

The following test vectors describe how the `channel_flags` byte should be
encoded depending on the values set:

```json
[
  {
    "channel_flags": {
      "announceChannel": false,
      "non_initiator_pays_commit_fees": false
    },
    "encoded": "0x00"
  },
  {
    "channel_flags": {
      "announceChannel": true,
      "non_initiator_pays_commit_fees": false
    },
    "encoded": "0x01"
  },
  {
    "channel_flags": {
      "announceChannel": false,
      "non_initiator_pays_commit_fees": true
    },
    "encoded": "0x02"
  },
  {
    "channel_flags": {
      "announceChannel": true,
      "non_initiator_pays_commit_fees": true
    },
    "encoded": "0x03"
  }
]
```

## Motivation

This feature would typically be used by mobile wallets purchasing liquidity
from their service provider. This allows mobile wallet users to onboard the
lightning network without requiring them to own and use a utxo. Since they
are purchasing liquidity, the service provider is incentivized to accept the
burden of paying the commitment fees.

This BLIP won't be necessary anymore once commitment transactions start using
[TRUC](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0431.mediawiki)
transactions and don't need to include mining fees.
